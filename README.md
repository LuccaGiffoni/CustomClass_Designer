# CustomClass_Designer
 How to create a full-custom class on C#. You'll create properties, fields and methods by yourself!
 
 # What I need to do?
 ## First
 Just copy the only two files of code you need - 'CreatingTheClass' and 'UsingTheClass'.
 
 ## Second
 Like the name tell us, the first file is where you create and define your class.
 The second one is where you can use and play with your class!
